This is a Game that I built with a partner in CS 190 introduction to python. THis was the final project in that class. 
its base3d off of the old game from windows called ski free. this is a much simpler version of it and still has lots of bugs.
We did get it working and played with lots of random variables with the program to change the landscape of the trees and where the 
skier started at the top of the screen.

To run this game download the .py file SKIFREE.py and both images provided create file with all three and open in THONEY.
Thoney is what we built it in, but you can probaly use in any python ide that supports tkinter.
